# Accessibility Analyzer — Project Aims

This document defines the individual aims of the **Backend** and **Frontend** components of the Accessibility Analyzer project, the current tech stack, and completed milestones.

---

## ✅ Backend — Project Aim

### 🎯 Aim

The backend service is responsible for **automating web accessibility audits** using `Puppeteer` and `axe-core`. It accepts a public website URL, loads the page in a headless browser, injects the axe-core script, and returns a structured list of **WCAG violations** found on that page.

This service is stateless, lightweight, and designed to be consumed by any frontend or API client.

Its aim is to **abstract away the complexity of browser automation and accessibility scanning**, exposing a clean REST API for accessibility evaluation.

### 📌 Core Responsibilities

- Accept and validate user-submitted URLs
- Run accessibility analysis using `axe-core`
- Return WCAG 2.0/2.1 violation reports in JSON
- Ensure fast and secure performance with headless browser isolation
- ✅ **[Planned]** Store/report logs or audit results to **Azure SQL** and **CosmosDB** for analytics or history tracking

---

## ✅ Frontend — Project Aim

### 🎯 Aim

The frontend provides an intuitive and responsive **user interface** that allows users to submit URLs and view accessibility analysis reports. Built using **React**, its main goal is to offer a clean workflow where users can easily:

1. Input a website URL
2. Trigger an audit
3. View categorized and formatted accessibility issues

The frontend bridges non-technical users with the audit engine by providing **accessible summaries, filters, and UI-friendly results**.

### 📌 Core Responsibilities

- Provide a URL submission form with validation
- Communicate with the backend via REST API
- Display real-time analysis results in a readable format
- Ensure the frontend is itself WCAG-compliant
- ✅ **[Planned]** Display audit history and logs fetched from the connected databases

## 🧱 Current Tech Stack & Structure

### 📁 Backend Structure

<pre lang="markdown"> ### 📁 Backend Folder Structure ```plaintext backend/ ├── config/ # Configuration files │ ├── mongo.js # CosmosDB (MongoDB API) connection setup │ └── sql.js # Azure SQL connection setup ├── .env # Environment variables for secrets and config ├── server.js # Main entry point to start the Express app ├── app.js # Express app setup with middleware (helmet, cors, etc.) ├── routes/ # API route definitions for audit-related actions ├── controllers/ # Business logic, like triggering analysis ├── models/ # Data models/schemas (e.g., audit logs, user submissions) ``` </pre>

### 💾 Database Stack

- **MongoDB (Cosmos DB - API for Mongo):**

  - Connected via `mongodb@3.6.10`
  - Auth via connection string in `.env`
  - Used for storing raw scan logs or JSON results

- **Azure SQL Database:**
  - Connected via `mssql` package
  - Used for structured audit metadata and analytics
  - Connection securely handled with environment variables

## ✅ Today's Progress (📅 13th May 2025)

### ✅ Database Integration Completed

- 🔌 Connected **Azure SQL Database** to the backend using the `mssql` package

  - SQL Server: `asad-sql-server-unique`
  - Database: `user-info-db`
  - IP firewall rule configured to allow development environment

- 🔗 Connected **Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API)** using `mongodb@3.6.10`

  - Cosmos DB Name: `asad-mongo-db`
  - Secure connection with SSL and retry logic

- ⚙️ Created modular connection files:

  - `config/sql.js` → Manages SQL connection
  - `config/mongo.js` → Manages Mongo connection

- ✅ All database connection tests completed successfully

## ✅ Today's Progress (📅 14th May 2025)

### 🧑‍💻 Authentication & User Management

- ✅ User login and authentication APIs are fully implemented
- ✅ Token-based authentication system integrated using **JSON Web Token (JWT)**
- ✅ `argon2` used for secure password hashing
- ✅ JWT middleware (`jwtAuth`) added to protect private routes
- ✅ Forgot password feature implemented using password reset logic
- ✅ User CRUD routes implemented:
  - Create user (Signup)
  - Login user
  - Update user
  - Delete user
  - Get all users
  - Get user by ID

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ All API test cases have been written and are passing
- ✅ End-to-end user creation and login flows tested manually
- ✅ Verified JWT token generation and route protection

### 📁 Database Integration

- ✅ Azure SQL Database connected and tested (`user-info-db`)
- ✅ Azure Cosmos DB (MongoDB API) connected and tested (`asad-mongo-db`)
- ✅ Created config files:
  - `config/sql.js` for SQL connection
  - `config/mongo.js` for Cosmos DB connection

### 👤 Example Test User (for manual login tests)

```json
{
  "name": "Asad Moinuddin",
  "email": "asad@example.com",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "password": "Test@1234"
}
```

## 🎯 Frontend Setup and Libraries
